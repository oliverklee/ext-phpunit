d0015cb5 Final preparation for release of version 3.2.21. Changes: ~ Changed default in ext_conf_template.txt for field 'excludeextensions': Now extension keys 'lib' and 'div' are per default excluded, since their testsuites try to load extension key 't3unit', which probably does not exist on peoples machines. * Fixed bug where phpunit could get stuck with 'Extension not loaded [...]'. Now, instead phpunit will default to extension key 'phpunit', if the chosen key does not exist anymore (which can happen if the extension is removed).

77412c12 Release 3.2.7.
744de33c Corrected error introduced when adding icons to dropdown boxes. Closes #7964, http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=7964.

5e77e4cc Updated PHPUnit to 3.2.17. Added extension icons to dropdown boxes.

e5a05d65 Version 3.2.4.
cbe9ce67 + Experimental support for Code Coverage reporting. Turned of by default, since you need to setup XDebug and it slows down unit testing considerably! + Added test for memory limit, which should be set to something like 256MB, when using code coverage! + New (experimental) progressbar: First stab at bugs #6972 and #6975. Turned off by default. Works badly: Overflows to the right, when there are many tests. * Errors are now marked red (instead of yellow). Solves bug #6977, http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=6977.

09cb535a ~ Changed header in BE module: It now writes the version string from the PHPUnit currently in use. This makes it easier to verify that the correct version is used. Closes http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=6985 * Removed white background from phpunit-be.css. * Changed path in ext_localconf.php to uppercase. Solves problem, where using the shipped PHPUnit did not work on systems where upper case / lower case is respected (e.g. Linux systems).
3bb79297 * Removed white background from phpunit-be.css.
06076e41 * Moved shipped PHPUnit to a PHPUnit sub-directory of PHPUnit-3.2.6.
